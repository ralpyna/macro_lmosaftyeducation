LMOSAFETY EDUCATION provides essential and useful lectures for the safety of researchers. The lecture is provided as a video on the web. The video is cropped into multiple frames, and you have to press the next button to continue watching. This makes it **uncomfortable for people who want to watch it all at once**. This application provides macros so that you can watch the lecture video at once.
